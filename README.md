# Conditional Probability

In this project, we build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm. Our goal is to create a spam filter that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% — so we expect that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam).
